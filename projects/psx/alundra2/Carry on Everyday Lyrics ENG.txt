I decided on my hairstyle and fashion.
I'm a girl
I want to change, if I'm bought, deep in my heart
Something is making noise

A love unlike any other
Dream, Where is my dream?
I carry on I carry on everyday
I'm looking for a brighter tomorrow

Stripping my heart naked
When you find the one you want
Don't be afraid, step out into a new world

What is the ordinary groom's side?
I want to run out of the crowd
I can't let it flow, I can't let it flow, deep inside my heart
Something is screaming

Love, I don't care if it hurts.
Dream, I want to test myself.
I carry on I carry on everyday
I want to destroy this repetitive tomorrow

A storm is coming to my heart
I can see myself starting to run
To be the only one in this world

Stripping my heart naked
I want to live the truth
Even if I stumble or wander
Don't stop, don't stop
[I carry on,
So I just want to be]
I just want to be myself
I carry on everyday
Don't be afraid, step out into a new world

A storm is coming to my heart
I can see myself starting to run
To be the only one in this world
